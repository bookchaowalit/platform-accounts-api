# cellkit notes

`src/cellkit/` is this service's own framework code. It was first generated from `cell.yaml` by the shared generator (solo-cell-kit, retired 2026-10-12), and it is changed here only. Nothing upstream is synced; other cells keep their own copies (owner decision 2026-10-21).

## Before Wave 2

At `64cb485` this copy was an older formatting of the same code (long lines, `timezone.utc`, a quoted `HostedCluster` return type); behaviour the same as the finance copy. In a comparison of all 24 cell copies (AST, comments and formatting ignored) there were only two behaviours: with or without Sentry `capture` on a failed inline publish.

## Changed in Wave 2 (2026-10-22)

- Strict typing (mypy strict on `cellkit.*` except the contract suite) and Ruff fixes; no behaviour change.
- `ranges` resource key: a write that leaves `[start, end]` both set must keep start <= end (422 `invalid_value`); only a patch that changes one of them is checked. No schema change.
- Integers are bounded to their column (`int` = 32-bit, `bigint`/`ref` = 64-bit) and real fields refuse NaN/Infinity: 422 instead of a 500 or a silent NULL. The 422 handler makes such inputs JSON-safe.
- A failed inline publish is passed to Sentry `capture()` as well as logged.
- Contract tests for each of these (`src/cellkit/contract.py`).

Commits touching `src/cellkit/` or `cell.yaml`:

- `78fa510 fix: refuse integers past their column and NaN/Infinity reals with 422`
- `0ce3047 test: integers past their column and non-finite reals must be refused with 422 (red)`
- `e2f1c4d chore: L2 baseline (lock, strict mypy, Ruff, rule tests, Sentry, PRODUCT.md, CI v1.1.1)`

## Fixes per need of this cell

| Fix | Does this cell need it? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Inline publish failure → Sentry | no: no resource has graph events, so the inline publisher never runs. The line is in the copy but inert. | — |
| `ranges` rule | no range declared in `cell.yaml`; the code is inert here. | — |
| Column limits / finite reals | yes: `mailbox.security_keys` | see contract test `test_numbers_fit_their_columns` |

## Deliberately not applied

- No other fix was skipped: no cell copy had a fix this one lacks after Wave 2, and there were no domain-specific differences to keep (the other differences were comments and formatting).

Change this code here, with a failing test first (ADR-0004). Records: `specs/` (SPEC-001 red/green log).
